# Express.js - Missing Error Handling in Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input or unexpected conditions.  Specifically, this example lacks proper handling when a requested user ID does not exist.

## Bug

The `GET /users/:id` route attempts to find a user based on the provided ID. If the ID is invalid or no user matches, the application crashes. The error is demonstrated in `bug.js`.

## Solution

The improved version, `bugSolution.js`, incorporates checks to handle missing users gracefully by returning an appropriate HTTP 404 response.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling in Express.js applications to prevent crashes and enhance user experience.
